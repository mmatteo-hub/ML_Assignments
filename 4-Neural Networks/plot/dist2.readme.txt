dist2
-----

dist2(X)
X (n x d)
returns the (n x n) matrix of distances from all rows to all rows.

dist2(X,Y)
X (n1 x d)
Y (n2 x d)
returns the (n1 x n2) matrix of distances from all rows of X to all rows of Y.

NOTE: distances = squared Euclidean distances - If x and y are vectors, this is sum((x-y).^2)
