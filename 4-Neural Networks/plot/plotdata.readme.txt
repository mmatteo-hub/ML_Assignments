plotdata
--------

plotdata(X)
X (n x d)
if d=1, plots the data in 2d along the diagonal (so effectively in 1d)
if d=2, plots the data in 2d as in "plot(X(:,1),X(:,2),'xb')"
if d>=3, plots the data in 3d using the first 3 cols
If you want to plot columns that are not the first ones, just select them
when passing the argument: "plotdata(X(:,[1 3]))"

plotdata(X,f)
f a character array (a string)
f is used to specify a style, e.g., "plotdata(X,'xr')"
